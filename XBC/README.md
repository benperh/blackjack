# Welcome to Blackjack!

A simple Blackjack game built using Python and Pygame. The goal of Blackjack is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding 21. 
The player competes against the dealer, and the player wins if their hand value is higher than the dealer's, or if the dealer busts (goes over 21). The player can place a bet before each turn.
